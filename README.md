  Our application, Find A Cause, seeks to help organizations gain volunteers for their events.  Likewise, Find A Cause helps volunteers
find work with organizations in their area.  The application works almost like a social network connecting volunteers and organizations
with events near to them.  The main goal of our application is to speed up the process of finding places to volunteer and signing up to
serve.  We hope that this application will encourage more volunteering with this quick approach.


	Upon entering Find A Cause, the user will be greeted with a calendar filled with events of organizations near them.  In order to sign 
up for an event, the user will have to create an account that will provide organizations with information on the user, such as
age, gender, name, hours of availability, etc.  If a user wants to change anything about their account they can always go to their 
profile and change any information they want.  Once a user has logged in, they are free to choose events to sign up for.  Right now, a
user can only signup through the homepage calendar, but in the future we plan to have a search machine so user's can find specific
organizations and view that organization's events.


	Organizations can also create accounts like users.  Organization accounts will contain contact information, location, a list of open
events, information about the organization's cause, and a postboard for the organization and volunteers to communicate.  A private
rating is also avaiable to the organization so the organization can get an idea of how impactful its events are and how volunteers
feel the work conditions of their events are.
